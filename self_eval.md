# Self Evaluation
1. When you have true or false statements or when you want to have more than one condition.  You can use && which means both are true or || when one part is true.  They also include if statements and comparators.
2. I would read through all of the arguments, synthesize what that means as far as coding and probably write more efficient code.
3. Today I mastered putting in the same line as previous in terminal to make sure it works by pushing the up arrow in the terminal. My code ran and it was less difficult to do than before; which means I may have a chance to be successful in this program.
